          programs, which act as a safety net for red pandas and may help

          products. If you visit red panda habitats, choose eco-friendly and
          responsible tour operators. Follow ethical wildlife viewing guidelines
          to minimize disturbance.

          <strong>Climate Action:</strong> Advocate for climate change
          mitigation efforts to reduce the impact of climate change on red panda
