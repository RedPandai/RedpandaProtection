      "The red panda belongs to its own unique family, Ailuridae, which is distinct from other well-known carnivore families like Felidae (cats) and Canidae (dogs). This separation at the family level underscores the red panda's evolutionary uniqueness. Within the family Ailuridae, there is only one species, Ailurus fulgens, which is commonly known as the red panda or lesser panda.",
